/**
 * The Branch Android Search SDK to power universal app search functionality.
 * <br><br>
 * This SDK is a thin wrapper with helper classes to assist in building search user experiences on

 * billions of deep links to app pages that Branch has indexed from its core linking platform used
 * by tens of thousands of mobile applications and websites.
 * <br><br>
 * This SDK is compatible with all Android devices running API 15 and above.
 * <br><br>
 * The main entry into the SDK is {@link io.branch.search.BranchSearch}.  To initialize the SDK
 * the following snippet can be used
 * <pre>
 *   BranchSearch.init(getApplicationContext());
 * </pre>
