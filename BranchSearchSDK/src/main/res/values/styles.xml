    <!-- Theme for BranchDeepViewFragment. The only valid parent for this theme would be
         "android:Theme.Dialog" but it has a very outdated appearance. For this reason
         we declare no parent and in BranchDeepViewFragment, we get a dialog theme from the
         runtime Context. Then we wrap that theme with the style below. -->
    <style name="BranchDeepViewFragment">
        <item name="android:windowMinWidthMajor">95%</item>
        <item name="android:windowMinWidthMinor">95%</item>
